# bpi-challenge-performance-analysis
This repository belongs to the proposal of the article "Analyzing How Process Mining Reports Answer
Time Performance Questions" of the CAISE 2022. The files in this repository are:

- The tables of annotations have the annotations related to the operations of each answer of each questions (tables of annotations BPI challenges).
- A table with all the operations grouped (grouped table of annotations).
- The codings about the terms (key concept code) and about the operations (OperationCoding).
- The log of the process to answer the questions with the operations in xes and csv format (log of analysis of time aspects).
- Notebooks used in the analysis:
	-- Analysis of frequent operations (frequent operations analysis)
	-- Analysis per bpi (analysis of answers grouping per bpi)
	+Analysis per categories (analysis of academics, students and professionals)
	+Analysis per question (analysis  of operations per question)
	+Analysis per question (variantes) (analysis of variants of operations per question)
	+Data reading and log creation (it reads the annotations and generate the log)
	+Graph of relationships (notebook to generate the graph)
	+Organizations (analysis of the organizations involved in the selected reports)
	+Pair comparison of winners vs no winners (analysis of winners and no winners per pairs of analysis)

- Reports BPI challenge
- Metricas2 is a file to generate the graph of relationships with the similarity metrics per pair of questions.
- Tables is a file which contains tables that complement the information in the paper.
